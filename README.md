**Car Auction Dashboard**
Car Auction Dashboard is a modern frontend application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS and Zustand.
It showcases practical, production-oriented UI development skills: data-driven components, filtering, routing, detail views, dashboard insights, and an interactive bidding simulation.

This project serves as a clean and modern example of professional frontend engineering for a developer portfolio.

This Storybook includes:

CarCard component (based on a custom Figma design)

Multiple story variants (Default, LongTitle, NoImage)

A full Figma → React → Storybook workflow

Visual regression testing powered by Chromatic CI

This demonstrates a component-driven development workflow, matching Autovex’s job requirement of building and maintaining reusable UI components with Storybook.
